## Short introduction to the project ##
Colony behaviour in ants is affected by how they interact with each other. Through these interactions, ants barter information that impact the allocation of tasks or functions among them. What is the specific role played by interaction networks in determining task allocation, and how this relates to the exchange of information flows between individual ants and between functional groups of ants - is relatively under-explored. 
In this project, we use robust network-based methods and metrics to a publicly available dataset of interaction networks in six Camponotus fellah colonies, where ants are nodes and their interactions are edges. We calculate network centrality metrics and certain entropy measures, and compute a switching interaction matrix, to explore how interaction patterns impact the switching behavior across three functional groups: foragers, cleaners and nurses.
